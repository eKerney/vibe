#### Workflow
Initiated using npx command and looks great, was able to authenticate using a gmail account.  
First asked Gemini to fix the pesky github PAT issue I've had on this machine using ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2.
Trying again after if set the incorrect path for the credential manager.
Seems that the problem is the lack of a graphical interface which is correct on WSL.
Finally the browser auth dialog popped up.

Installing Gemini via npm vs using the npx command to run without installing
```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```
Planning to test using gemini to automate Market Research in the Geospatial Domain.   
OK so far this looks great! 
I asked gemini to create a jupyter notebook I could use to 'query' my linkedin feed for any post and information related to the Geospatial market.
It was able to generate a requirements.txt and notebook with what I had asked for, now on to testing!

#### 8-15-2025
The notebook didn't work at first, and had some characters that VSCode could not parse properly from the JSON.
This took a couple of tries, and Gem was able to eventually fix the issue when told what the errors were.
Instructions to follow for using cookie to query
1. Log in to LinkedIn in your regular browser (like Chrome or Firefox).                                                                                
2. Open the developer tools in your browser. You can usually do this by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect".                                                                                                                                          
3. Go to the "Application" or "Storage" tab and find the cookies for linkedin.com.                                                                     
4. Find the cookie named `li_at` and copy its value.
