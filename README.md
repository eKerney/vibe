#### Workflow
Initiated using npx command and looks great, was able to authenticate using a gmail account.  
First asked Gemini to fix the pesky github PAT issue I've had on this machine using ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2.
Trying again after if set the incorrect path for the credential manager.
Seems that the problem is the lack of a graphical interface which is correct on WSL.
